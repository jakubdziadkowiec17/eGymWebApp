# eGym - Web Application

The project focuses on designing and building software to operate a gym network. It presents a powerful tool enabling the management of facilities in a gym chain and providing customers with the opportunity to make informed decisions. It provides booking and easy access to information, minimizing uncertainty and restrictions in planning training. The application also allows you to streamline the employee's daily duties and strategic decision-making. The application offers a web application with a database system designed for it. It is also possible to actively promote the gym chain on the home page through content management. It is an application with maintained website responsiveness, enabling the user to access it on various devices. The database system and software allow for the operation of all gyms in the network. The software has a simple and clear interface. It also offers performance, safety and ease of use. Each action performed by the user is saved in a file. This creates the so-called log system. The project enables multiple users to operate in the system at the same time. The project is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. With the help of modern tools and technologies, it also enabled the effective implementation of the system. Technologies used in the project:
